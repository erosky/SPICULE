ERROR LOG
------------------
The following slides are invalid for data

C3S1	2028	600.0

Slide got stuck in "slide loaded" state (blue)
Actuator "Pull
Pickup "Down"
Shuttle "Home"

Josh fixed by doing "Stop all", "Expose", "Retract"
Slide was expose for a second or two.

C3S2	2054	600.0	

alt 5150m-5800m, some moisture present, mostly clear air, cloud work began 2001
Timer expired at 2105 and instrument became stuck in an unknown state
Actuator "Pull"
Pickup "Down"
Shuttle "Unknown"

Josh used "Home Shuttle" command, which moved shuttle state to "Home" and slide to "Loaded"
Error message when passing "Retract" command: "Linear Stage is not in position to retract slide"
Error message persists after restaring GNI GUI software.
Solved by exposing again, and then retracting.

C3S3	2116	10.0

Test slide after recovering previous slide

C6S1	2158	10.0

accidentally set timer for 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes

Pickup "Down"
Shuttle "Home"

Elise fixed by doing "Stop all", "Expose", "Retract"

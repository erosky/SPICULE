Forward-Looking Digital Camera Imagery
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/605.003

Summary
During SPICULE, the NSF/NCAR HIAPER GV (Tail Number N677F) flew a forward
looking digital camera for in-flight video capture. Individual photo jpeg
images were captured once per second during flights. Images taken after dark
have been stripped from this archive. The remaining images have been combined
into hour long tarfiles running from zero minutes zero seconds (or the start
time of the first file) to 23 minutes 59 seconds (or the end time of the last
file) after each hour. Note that the first and last tarfile for each flight
will contain less than a full hour of imagery. Directory files returned with
each order give the contents of each corresponding tar file.

NCAR HCR radar moments data
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/605.011

Summary
HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) data collected aboard the NSF/NCAR GV HIAPER
(Gulfstream-V High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for
Environmental Research, HIAPER) (N677F) during SPICULE (Secondary Production
of Ice in Cumulus Experiment). The data were collected during 10 research
flights which took place between May 29 and June 25, 2021, over the US Great
Plains.

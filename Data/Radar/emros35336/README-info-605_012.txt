NCAR HCR radar time series data
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/605.012

Summary
HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) data collected aboard the NSF/NCAR GV HIAPER
(Gulfstream-V High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for
Environmental Research, HIAPER) (N677F) during SPICULE (Secondary Production
of Ice in Cumulus Experiment). The data were collected during 10 research
flights which took place between May 29 and June 25, 2021, over the US Great
Plains. The dataset contains the raw in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q)
information archived as time series. Note: Each data file is ~10 G large.
Please do not order more than 3 minutes of data at one time.
